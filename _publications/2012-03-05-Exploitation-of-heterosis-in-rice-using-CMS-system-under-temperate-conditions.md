**Abstract**


The present study was conducted to evaluate 36 cross combinations developed by crossing 2 CMS lines with 18 testers in line x tester mating design to identify effective restores and maintainers from elite lines and work out best heterotic combinations in terms of yield and yield components. Assessment of standard heterosis based on standard checks (SR-1 and Jhelum) of effectively restored cross combinations showed that there was significant heterosis for all the traits except number of filled grains per panicle and the degree of heterosis varied from trait to trait. The entire cross combinations that showed superiority over standard checks for grain yield per plant also showed significant heterosis for majority of other traits. The best cross combination in terms of grain yield was SKAU7A x K-08-61-2 and for early maturity SKAU11A x SR-2 over check SR-1 only. In terms of restoration ability of genotypes 3 lines were categorized as effective restores viz. K-08-61-2, K-08-60-2 and SR-2 and 5 lines were categorized as maintainers viz. SKAU-405, Jhelum, SKAU-407, China-1007 and SKAU-391. The average proportion of restorers, partial restorers, partial maintainers and maintainers were 16:22:33:27, respectively.
