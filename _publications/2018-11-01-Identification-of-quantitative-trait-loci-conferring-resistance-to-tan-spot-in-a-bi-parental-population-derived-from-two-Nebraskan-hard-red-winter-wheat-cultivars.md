excerpt: 'This paper characterizes the Tan spot resistance in Harry and Wesley cultivars and reveals high resistance to tan spot in Wesley cultivar is largely due to lack of two <i> Ptr ToxA-Tsn1 </i>  and <i> Ptr ToxC-Tsc1 </i> tan spot sensitivity genes.'

Tan spot, caused by <i> Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr) <i\>, is a destructive foliar disease in all types of cultivated wheat worldwide. Genetics of tan spot resistance in wheat is complex, involving insensitivity to fungal-produced necrotrophic effectors (NEs), major resistance genes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring race-nonspecific and race-specific resistance. The Nebraska hard red winter wheat (HRWW) cultivar ‘Wesley’ is insensitive to <i>Ptr ToxA <i\>and highly resistant to multiple <i>Ptr <i/>races, but the genetics of resistance in this cultivar is unknown. In this study, we used a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Wesley and another Nebraska cultivar ‘Harry’ (<i> Ptr ToxA <i/> sensitive and highly susceptible) to identify QTL associated with reaction to tan spot caused by multiple races/isolates. Sensitivity to <i>Ptr ToxA<i\> conferred by the <i>Tsn1<i\> gene was mapped to chromosome 5B as expected. The Tsn1locus was a major susceptibility QTL for the race 1 and race 2 isolates, but not for the race 2 isolate with the <i>ToxA<i\> gene deleted. A second major susceptibility QTL was identified for all the <i>Ptr ToxC<i\>-producing isolates and located to the distal end of the chromosome 1A, which likely corresponds to the <i>Tsc1<i\> locus. Three additional QTL with minor effects were identified on chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D. This work indicates that both <i>Ptr ToxA-Tsn1<i\> and <i>Ptr ToxC-Tsc1<i\>interactions are important for tan spot development in winter wheat, and Wesley is highly resistant largely due to the absence of the two tan spot sensitivity genes.
