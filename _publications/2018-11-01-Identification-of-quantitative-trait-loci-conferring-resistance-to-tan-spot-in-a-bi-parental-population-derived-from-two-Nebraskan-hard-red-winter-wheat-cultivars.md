**Abstract**

Tan spot, caused by *Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr)*, is a destructive foliar disease in all types of cultivated wheat worldwide. Genetics of tan spot resistance in wheat is complex, involving insensitivity to fungal-produced necrotrophic effectors (NEs), major resistance genes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring race-nonspecific and race-specific resistance. The Nebraska hard red winter wheat (HRWW) cultivar ‘Wesley’ is insensitive to *Ptr ToxA* and highly resistant to multiple *Ptr* races, but the genetics of resistance in this cultivar is unknown. In this study, we used a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Wesley and another Nebraska cultivar ‘Harry’ (*Ptr ToxA* sensitive and highly susceptible) to identify QTL associated with reaction to tan spot caused by multiple races/isolates. Sensitivity to *Ptr ToxA* conferred by the *Tsn1* gene was mapped to chromosome 5B as expected. The Tsn1locus was a major susceptibility QTL for the race 1 and race 2 isolates, but not for the race 2 isolate with the *ToxA* gene deleted. A second major susceptibility QTL was identified for all the *Ptr ToxC* producing isolates and located to the distal end of the chromosome 1A, which likely corresponds to the *Tsc1* locus. Three additional QTL with minor effects were identified on chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D. This work indicates that both *Ptr ToxA-Tsn1* and *Ptr ToxC-Tsc1* interactions are important for tan spot development in winter wheat, and Wesley is highly resistant largely due to the absence of the two tan spot sensitivity genes.
