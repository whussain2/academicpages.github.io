**Abstract**

Genome-wide association mapping identifies quantitative trait loci (QTL) that influ-ence the mean differences between the marker genotypes for a given trait. Whilemost loci influence the mean value of a trait, certain loci, known as variance het-erogeneity QTL (vQTL) determine the variability of the trait instead of the meantrait value (mQTL). In the present study, we performed a variance heterogeneitygenome-wide association study (vGWAS) for grain cadmium (Cd) concentration inbread wheat. We used double generalized linear model and hierarchical generalizedlinear model to identify vQTL associated with grain Cd. We identified novel vQTLregions on chromosomes 2A and 2B that contribute to the Cd variation and loci thataffect both mean and variance heterogeneity (mvQTL) on chromosome 5A. In addi-tion, our results demonstrated the presence of epistatic interactions between vQTLand mvQTL, which could explain variance heterogeneity. Overall, we provide novelinsights into t he genetic architecture of grain Cd concentration and report the firstapplication of vGWAS in wheat. Moreover, our findings indicated that epistasis is animportant mechanism underlying natural variation for grain Cd concentration
