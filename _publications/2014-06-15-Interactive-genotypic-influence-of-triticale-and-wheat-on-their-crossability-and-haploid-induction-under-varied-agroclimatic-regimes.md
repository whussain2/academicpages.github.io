**Abstract**


The investigation was undertaken at two different climatic regimens of NW Himalayas, to determine the response of diverse genotypes of triticale and wheat and environment on their crossability as well as to evaluate the efficiency of *Imperata cylindrica*-mediated chromosome elimination approach for haploid induction in triticale × wheat (*Triticum aestivum*) hybrids. The experimental material included three elite hexaploid triticale genotypes (DT123, DT126 and TL9335) and five bread wheat genotypes (DH40, HPW155, HS295, VL829 and C306). Significant genotypic and environmental variations were observed for seed setting at two agroclimatic zones. Among parental genotypes, DT126 (triticale) and C306, HPW155 and HS295 (wheat) responded significantly better for seed setting due to significant positive GCA effects at both locations. Maximum seed set of 39.53% and 45.37% was recorded at short day and long day climates, respectively, proving later as the better location for seed setting in most of the crosses. For all the three parameters of haploid induction, viz. pseudoseed formation, embryo formation and regeneration, significant differences were recorded in all the triticale × wheat hybrids depicting the potential of *I. cylindrica*-mediated approach for haploid induction. Triticale × wheat cross DT126 × HS295 followed by DT126 × HPW155 were found to be significantly more responsive towards embryo formation and regeneration.
