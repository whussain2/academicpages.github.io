**Abstract**

Different concentrations of auxins have been established as post pollination treatment for haploid induction in wheat, triticale and their derivatives. Hence, the study was designed to assess different possible auxin analogues like 2,4-D, NAA, IAA and IBA for their influence on haploid induction in triticale x wheat backcross generations (BC1F1, BC1F2, BC1F3) through *Imperata cylindrica*-mediated chromosome elimination approach of doubled haploid (DH) breeding. After 24 hours of pollination, five spikes of each cross were injected with different auxin analogues in varying concentrations (100 and 250 ppm for NAA, IAA, IBA, 2,4-D) in the uppermost internode of the plant and repeated for two consecutive days during the years 2013 and 2014. Additionally, acid blue 9 (marker in herbicide preparations), was also used with variable concentrations (100, 150, 200 and 250 ppm) of 2,4-D. The study revealed non-significant effect of acid blue 9 on the function of 2,4-D, thus offered an opportunity to be used as a marker to trace the metabolic pathway of the latter. Injection of 250 ppm of 2,4-D after 24 hours of pollination for three consecutive days was identified as the most effective dose for haploid induction in triticale x wheat backcrosses.
