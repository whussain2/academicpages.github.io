**Abstract**

Liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium in varying strengths, is the most commonly utilized medium for proficient rooting in the regenerated plants in doubled haploidy breeding protocols. On the other side, CPV (cocopeat: perlite: vermiculite) medium is currently being used in hardening of tissue culture regenerated plants. Hence, the present study was designed to check the relative efficacy of both media for the development of various root characteristics in triticale and wheat derived haploid plantlets. Significant difference for root traits was observed in both media revealing higher average root length of the plantlets (22.04cm) in CPV than that of half strength liquid MS medium (14.54cm). Further, average root surface area increased almost four times in CPV (21.14cm^2) than liquid medium (5.53cm^2). Similarly mean number of roots was also found to be more (seven) in CPV than liquid medium (five). The survival rate of haploids after colchicine application from liquid medium was observed to be far less than in CPV. Conclusively, CPV medium was observed as more efficient alternative to liquid medium for high recovery of doubled haploid
