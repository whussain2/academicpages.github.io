**Abstract**

Generation mean analysis of the six populations of the two oat crosses viz., PLP-1 x *Avena sterilis* and Kent x *Avena sterilis* was chosen to study the nature and magnitude of gene effects for forage and grain yield traits. Results revealed that epistatic gene effect cannot be ignored when establishing a new breeding program to improve oat populations for various traits. The inheritance of all traits studied was controlled by additive and nonadditive genetic effects, with greater values of dominance gene effect than the additive one in most cases. Biparental mating which could exploit both additive and non-additive type of gene effects was suggested for the improvement of the traits in the crosses studied.
