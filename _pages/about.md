Biography
======
------
I'm a plant breeder and quantitative geneticist. Currently, a post-doctoral research associcate  at the University of Nebraska Lincoln working with [Gota Morota](http://morotalab.org/) and [Harkamal Walia](http://cropstressgenomics.org/).  Currently, my research focuses on (i) applying quantitative genetics methods for genome-wide association and genomic prediction of longitudinal traits derived from high-throughput phenotyping platforms for high-night temperature stress in rice and wheat; (ii) modelling variance-heterogeneity in genome-wide association studies using novel statistical tools; and (iii) develop applications related to quantitative genetic studies.

Outside of my professional life I enjoy playing cricket, travelling, reading, and spending time with family.

Research Interests
======
------
* Incorporating quantitative genetics, statistical genomics, genomics, bioinformatics and high-throughput phenotyping to bridge the gap between phenotype and genotype.
* Mapping (via linkage and or association) genomic regions with emphasis on biotic and abiotic stresses.
* Genomic selection/predictions in cultivar and hybrid development.
* Gene characterization, cloning and isolation, and integration marker-assisted breeding

Motivation
------
======
I am highly motivated in my goals to be part of a nationally and internationally research breeding programs with both basic and applied research components, along with a strong focus on delivering solutions to the current issues of crop breeding in genomics era, availability of high throughput phenotyping and genotyping platforms, and high computing resources. Innovation, collaboration, problem identification followed by scientific redressal, and along with responsiveness to the needs of the farming community serve basis for my passion to work in plant breeding. In all aspects of my work, I emphasize critical thinking and strong partnerships between plant breeders and geneticists and scientists from allied disciplines in to promote a scientifically sound, profitable, and sustainable research-based breeding programs.
