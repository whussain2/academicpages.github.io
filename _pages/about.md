I'm Waseem, a plant breeder and quantitative geneticist. Currently, I am a post-doctoral research associcate  at the University of Nebraska Lincoln working with [Gota Morota](http://morotalab.org/) and [Harkamal Walia](http://cropstressgenomics.org/). My background is plant breeding and genetics, molecular breeding, and quantitative genetics. Currently, my research focuses (i) applying methods in quantitative genetics for genome-wide association and genomic prediction of longitudinal traits derived from high-throughput phenotyping platforms in rice and wheat; (ii) modelling variance-heterogeneity in genome-wide association studies using novel statistical tools; and (iii) develop applications related to quantitative genetic studies.

Outside of my professional life I enjoy playing cricket, travelling, reading, and spending time with family.

Research Interests
======
Interested in incorporating quantitative genetics, statistical genomics, bioinformatics and high-throughput phenotyping to bridge the gap between phenotype and genotype. The primary research areas I want to focus is a characterization of alleles and diversity analysis using advanced genomic technologies, mapping (via linkage and or association) QTLs with emphasis on biotic and abiotic stresses, genomic selection/predictions in cultivar and hybrid development, gene cloning and characterization of candidate genes and marker-assisted breeding.
