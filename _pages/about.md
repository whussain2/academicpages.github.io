Biography
======
------
I'm a plant breeder and quantitative geneticist. Currently, a post-doctoral research associate  at the University of Nebraska Lincoln working with [Gota Morota](http://morotalab.org/) from Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) and [Harkamal Walia](http://cropstressgenomics.org/) from Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, University of Nebraska, Lincoln.  Currently, my research focuses on (i) applying quantitative genetics methods for genome-wide association and genomic prediction of longitudinal traits derived from high-throughput phenotyping platforms for high-night temperature stress in rice and wheat; (ii) modeling variance-heterogeneity in genome-wide association studies using novel statistical tools; and (iii) develop R-packages and Shiny applications.

Outside of my professional life I enjoy playing cricket, traveling, reading, and spending time with family.

Research Interests
======
------
* Incorporating quantitative genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, statistics and high-throughput phenotyping to bridge the gap between phenotype and genotype
* Mapping (via linkage and or association) genomic regions with emphasize on biotic and abiotic stresses
* Genomic selection/predictions in cultivar and hybrid development
* Gene characterization, cloning and isolation, and integration through marker-assisted breeding

Motivation
======

------

I am highly motivated in my goals to be part of a nationally and internationally small grains research programs with both basic and applied research components, along with a strong focus on delivering solutions to the current issues of cereal genetics in advanced genomics era and availability of high throughput phenotyping platforms. Innovation, collaboration, problem identification followed by scientific redressal serve basis for my passion to work in plant genetics. In all aspects of my work, I emphasize critical thinking and strong partnerships between scientists in different allied disciplines to promote a scientifically sound and sustainable research programs.
