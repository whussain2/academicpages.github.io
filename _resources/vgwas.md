## Background

This page provides links to the R scripts used to model variance-heterogeneity in the context of GWAS called as vGWAS. In the vGWAS we model variance instead of mean of marker genotypes. For more details on vGWAS and modelling please see our [manuscript information](https://chikudaisei.shinyapps.io/shinyaim/) for more information.
