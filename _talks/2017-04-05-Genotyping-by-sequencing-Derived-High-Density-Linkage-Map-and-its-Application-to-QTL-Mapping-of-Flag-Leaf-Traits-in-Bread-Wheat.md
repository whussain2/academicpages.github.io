In this talk I discuss about the development of linkage map in Harry x Wesley derived RIL population. I also discussed about our newly developed pipeline using R/qtl and ASMap how to correct for genotyping errors in genotyping-by-sequencing derived SNPs. Also, talked about the validity, accuracy and comparison of the developed linkage map with newly developed genome assembly of wheat. Lastly, discuss the application of linkage map in identifying QTLs for plant height.  The talk is on [webpage](https://www.k-state.edu/pbg/symposium2017/morning-session-ii.html). The detailed instruction about the R codes used to correct can be found in supplementary materials published in Scientific reports journal at [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16006-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16006-z)
