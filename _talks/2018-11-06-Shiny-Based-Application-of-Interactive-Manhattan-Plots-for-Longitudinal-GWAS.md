Here I am talking Shiny based application called as ShinyAIM. I developed this application in R and Shiny aimed to visualize the interactive Manhattan plots generated from GWAS outputs particularly for longitudinal data. The paper describing the ShinyAIM is published in Journal Plant Direct and can be found [here](https://doi-org.libproxy.unl.edu/10.1002/pld3.91).
